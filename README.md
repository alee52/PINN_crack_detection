# CRACK DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING (Under construction)

Essential files in this repository:
1) elasticity_with_crack: assume the slippage and crack is known and the crack is closed in to a closed surface. For the purpose of experimenting, we choose the crack to be straight line connecting two points $(-0.4, 0)$ and $(0.4, 0)$. Physics Informed Neural Network is utilized to solve the *forward* and compared agaisnt DG method (see data).
2) inverse_problem_known_crack: the slippage is unknown but the crack line is known.
